Project Title: Deep Learning-Based Dental Cavity Detection Overview This project is an automated diagnostic tool designed to detect dental cavities from X-ray or clinical images using Deep Learning. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into categories such as "Cavity Detected" or "No Cavity Detected"
